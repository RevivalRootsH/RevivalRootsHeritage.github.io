            <h2>About Alexander Township</h2>
            <img src="alexandra-township.jpg" alt="Alexandra Township" class="image-main">
            <p><strong>Alexander Township, also known as Alex, is one of South Africa's oldest and most vibrant communities...</strong></p>
            <strong><p>Life in Alexandra Township, also known as Alex, is constantly moving, and the area is vibrant and home to many. However, as an informal settlement, the area also experiences many downfalls, ranging from poverty and social issues to a lack of municipal facilities. Despite these issues, those who call Alexandra home have made the most of their living situation. The area is considered a vibrant informal hub against the contrasting backdrop of the wealthiest square mile in Africa. The township is more than just an informal settlement, with a rich history dating back to the early 1900s.</p></strong>
            <h3>What Is Alexandra Known For?</h3>
            <p><strong>What makes this bustling hub stand out from other informal settlements in South Africa? Here are five interesting facts about Alexandra township, from its origins to the size of the area and the amount of South Africans that call it home.</strong></p>
            <h3>#5: Why is the place called Dark City?</h3>
            <p><strong>Alex had struggled with insufficient infrastructure for decades, including no electricity. Reverend Sam Buti was the first house to receive electricity in the early 1970s. Reverand Sam Buti was an internal part of the townships, spearheading the Save Alex Campaign in the late 1970s.</strong></p>
            <h3>#4: <Strong>How About A 800 Hectres Of Land!</h3>
            <p><strong>Alex contrasts many townships that are far from urban areas and much smaller than others. Wits University research team reported that the <strong>informal settlement is over 800 hectares</strong>, 1 square mile, or 7.6 square kilometres. It is also near major travelling routes.</strong></p>
            <h3>#3: "Umzabalazo" the township successfully protested against bus fare increases in 1940.</h3>
            <p><strong>In 1940, residents protested to boycott buses as the city wanted to increase the fare from four pennies to give, with one penny worth R1 in today's currency. The residents protested diligently for six months, walking 15 km into town and back. Following the six-month mark, the fees dropped. The issue was raised again, but the residents won that battle, too.</strong></p>
            <h3>#2: <strong>R1.3 Billion For The Township</h3>
            <p><strong>Recognising a dire need for infrastructure improvement in the heavily populated area, former president Thabo Mbeki announced the Alexandra Renewal Project in Febuary 2001. The project allocated R1.3 billion in expenditure over seven years for upgrades, which helped the impoverished area tremendously.</p>
            <h3>#1: The Township Is An International Tourist Attraction Spot In SA</h3>
            <p><strong>Although the township was still a struggling informal settlement, the necessary upgrades and tenacity of the residents have made Alexandra township a must-see for tourists. Local tourism companies take international visitors to various landmarks and must-sees in the informal settlement, complete with an insightful tour guide and some writing about their unique experience.</strong></p>

            <h2>History of Alexander Township</h2>
            <h3>The Rich History Began In 1904</h3>
             <p><strong>The township began as a humble farm bought by wealthy farmer Papenfus. He moved his family and family cook to the farm, and Papenfus planned to farm milk to take to Johannesburg. Hey Nxele Mbanjwa, his cook, brought her then five-year-old daughter Annie with her, who went on to have ten kids once older.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Established in 1912, Alexander Township has been a center of resilience, struggle, and triumph during South Africa's apartheid era. It is home to notable figures such as Nelson Mandela, who lived here before moving to Soweto.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>How The Plots Gave Black People The Land</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The farm was divided into plots as it expanded into something huge.Once more jobs became available in the area following the expansion of mines, black families settled nearby. Papenfus divided the Zandfontein farm into plots and sold them to black families, giving them a chance to own land that the 1913 Land Act stole from them.</strong></p>
